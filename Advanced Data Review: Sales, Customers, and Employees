-- For this project, I addressed the following questions in SQLite Studio utilizing imported sales, customer, and employee data.


-- Show customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the USA.

SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country 
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country='USA'


-- Show only customers from Brazil.

SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country 
FROM customers
WHERE country='Brazil';


-- Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT firstname, lastname, i.invoiceid, i.invoicedate, i.billingcountry
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i
ON c.customerid=i.customerid
WHERE c.country='Brazil';


-- Show the employees who are Sales Support Agents.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE title='Sales Support Agent';

-- Find total sales by Slales Support Agent. 

SELECT employeeid, lastname, firstname, title, SUM(i.total) AS sales
FROM EMPLOYEES e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid=employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid=c.customerid
GROUP BY employeeid;
