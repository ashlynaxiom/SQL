-- In this project I completed the SQL Murder Mystery created by Joon Park and Cathy He through Knight Lab.
-- The project included reviewing data from several tables and JOINing the data to determine a solution. 


-- Review Crime Scene Reports

SELECT date, type, description, city from crime_scene_report
WHERE city='SQL City' AND type='murder';


-- Identify Witnesses

SELECT ID, NAME, license_id, address_number, ADDRESS_STREET_NAME, ssn
FROM PERSON
WHERE NAME like '%Annabel%;

SELECT ID, NAME, license_id, address_number, ADDRESS_STREET_NAME, ssn
FROM PERSON
WHERE ADDRESS_STREET_NAME like '%Northwestern%'
ORDER BY address_number DESC;


-- Review Witness #1's Statement

SELECT * FROM INTERVIEW
WHERE PERSON_ID='16371';


-- Review Witness #2's Statement

SELECT * FROM INTERVIEW
WHERE PERSON_ID='14887';


-- Review Membership IDs based on Witness #2's Statement for Possible Suspects

SELECT * FROM GET_FIT_NOW_MEMBER
WHERE ID LIKE '%48Z%';


-- Review Gym Check In to pull who was at the gym at the same time as Annabel

SELECT id, name, c.check_in_date, c.check_in_time, c.check_out_time
FROM get_fit_now_member
JOIN get_fit_now_check_in c
ON c.membership_id=get_fit_now_member.id
WHERE c.check_in_date LIKE '20180109';


-- Review License Plates based on Witness #2's Statement and compare to who was at the gym at the same time as Annabel

SELECT id, name, license_id, dl.age, dl.height, dl.hair_color, dl.eye_color, dl.gender, dl.plate_number
FROM person
JOIN drivers_license dl
ON person.license_id=dl.id
WHERE dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';


-- Task completed.
