In this project I addressed the following questions by utilizing SQLite with imported data customer and sales data.


-- Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY&'
GROUP BY Location
HAVING COUNT(orderid)>2;


-- How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as Total_Items_Sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;


-- What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT AVG(quantity*price) as Total_Spent
FROM FebSales f
LEFT JOIN Customers c
ON f.orderid=c.order_id;


-- What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(c.acctnum) as AVG_Items_Per_Acct
FROM FebSales f
LEFT JOIN Customers c
ON f.orderid=c.order_id;


-- Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity*price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) DESC
LIMIT 1;


-- How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM JanSales;


-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';


-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT c.acctnum, f.orderid
FROM FebSales f
INNER JOIN Customers C
WHERE c.order_id=f.orderid;


-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Product, price
FROM JanSales
GROUP by Product
ORDER BY price asc;


-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM JanSales 
GROUP BY Product;


-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, 
SUM(Quantity), 
SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;


-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
COUNT(distinct c.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales f
LEFT JOIN Customers c
ON f.orderid=c.order_id


-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity), Location
FROM FebSales
WHERE Location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;


-- Additional Review

SELECT orderdate
FROM FebSales
WHERE orderdate BETWEEN '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';


SELECT location
FROM FebSales
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';


SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';


SELECT DISTINCT Product
FROM FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%';


SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM FebSales
WHERE Price like '%.99';
WHERE f.quantity>2;
